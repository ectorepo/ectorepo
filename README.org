* Ectorepo

This is a git repo full of submodules to [[https://android.googlesource.com/tools/repo][Repo]] [[https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest/][projects]] made of git repos. The
capital R in Repo matters. Technically, this can be done with HTTPS and an XML
manifest server ... but I'm special. I'll be using git submodules.

** What is a Git Playlist, Trebek

I've created this organization to separate these "git playlist" manifest repos
from my own Github. And I've created this project for me personally. Expect
incomplete documentation and such. The power of google Repo could be in your
hands. There is almost zero documentation avaiable for it on the web. It
downloads a copy of its own python scripts. That's your best bet. That, or this
repo.

** Caveats

Also, I've just started to use Google Repo, so I'm not exactly an expert.

Further, I won't exactly be using it as designed. It's a bit heavy handed for
what I want, but for git & VC automation I'd rather invest my time learning an
over-engineered tool. Google repo is a devops tool developed for Android and
Chromium OS that is used to automation/instrumentation/hooks builds and tests.
These projects are massive and involve collaboration of thousands of developers.
To make matters more complicated, both Android and Chromium OS need to support
legacy hardware/software. So Repo allows developers to specify manifest branches
that pin specific subproject branchs for various build scenarios.

And the next thing you'll be learning in your Google onboarding is why C++
compiler design could not be rectified for the scale of software Google was
building, necessitating =Go= and =bazel=. But the real question there is =Why=
-- for which any sufficiently technical answer affirmatively deserves an
"Achievment Unlocked" next to that "Arctic Code Repository" badge of yours.

Bonus points if you manage to explain it using these [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQX2HjkcNo][Peano Arithmatic cards]].

* Why Repo?

/As with all time-tested things/, there are several reasons providing
justification or motivation.

#+begin_quote
A corollary to the previous statement is that, without /sufficient socialized
upkeep/ to maintain a large work, what could fall apart *almost certainly* does.
It's one of the darker conclusions one might reach when reflecting on social
cooperation while integrating both network theory and statistical models (where
social models with interdependence are more effectively approximated with
dependence than independence)
#+end_quote

In other words, as the Greeks and Buddhists recognized, chaos is the natural
state of things. Any order that arises is transient, sometimes serendipitous and
/special/. Great projects require socializing the upkeep for nurturing them as
one might tend a garden. _When we can do this more efficiently, we can accomplish
more collectively._ This is why, no matter how great or small, almost all
programming languages or projects eventually die (unless..)

This, in essence, is the mystery of the pyramids and, by extension, of the
sphinx. But, alas, I digress...

** Manage Hundreds of Repos for Reference

Yep, find-grep works here. What is the substance of this =ectorepo=
organization's repositories, anyways? I want to provide a place where I can
share the tools I use to learn more faster.

I want to integrate some of my code analysis tools, literate programming style,
to org documents at the root of the manifest repos. As in human language, with
computering langauge I also have a hard time keeping track of and integrating
the vocabularly of hundreds of API's that I would like to have /vorhanden/ --
lit. ready at hand. In my own uphill battles with neurology, I have found the
following techniques invaluable:

+ UML diagrams and graphviz diagrams
+ Note-taking applications & frameworks
+ Journaling my installiations
+ Zettelkausten techniques and indexed notes

I want to configure/script tools to use, like [[https://gitlab.com/mtekman/elisp-depmap.el][Elisp Depmap]] to generate diagrams
inline with the scripts I use to generate them.

** Build & Infrastructure Automation

Repo offers [[https://android.googlesource.com/tools/repo/+/HEAD/docs/repo-hooks.md][hooks]] and, with some duct tape, integration into CI systems that run
tests and containerized applications with

** Worktree

It looks like repo doesn't integrate well with git worktrees AFAIK, which is a
real shame. Automation and worktrees are useful when co

** Orgmode and Org Roam

There are a few killer apps for emacs: magit, org, org-roam, org-noter and
others. I want to use them, but like all great copy & paste programmers know,
with crappy automation, you had one problem and now you have one hundred.



* Getting Started

** Doing your first =repo sync=

1. Install Google Repo with something like =sudo pacman -Syu repo=
2. Get a manifest.xml via:
   + Specifying a manifest repo with a =default.xml=.
   + Cloning a repo with a manifest XML definition.
   + Building a manifest XML according to Google's Manifest DTD.
3. Do a =repo init= via:
   + Manifest Git or XML URL: =repo init -u $URL=
   + File: =repo init -m $XML_FILE=
4. Do a =repo sync= and, even if your XML is all good, you'll probably run into
   branch naming issues... /this is why we can't have nice things/.
5. Update the XML =<defaults/>= and =<project/>= tags with the appropriate
   =revision= properties. Then cross your fingers and try =repo sync= once
   again... /just be glad you're not Google devops or a Google VP/.

** Using the manifest repositories in this project

You have three options to start with:

1. If you want all the manifest repo's (and you probably don't) -- clone this
   repo, then init/update the submodules. Then cd to the file locations of your
   choice and run =repo sync -m $XML_FILE=
2. Clone the manifests for groups of git repo's that you want using =repo sync
   -u $URL=. This is what I would recommend, initially, as large repos like
   Android or ChromiumOS can require 10+ gigabytes if you don't use additional
   =repo sync= options.
3. Use the org-babel blocks below to cobble together a manifest using an
   existing set of git repositories. You can use =repo sync= with the =-m
   $XML_FILE= option when building the manifest or =-u $URL= option if you'd
   prefer to push it to a git remote.
   - These don't account for git submodules and other edge cases.
   - I developed these examples for my purposes on my systems.
   - You will likely have to iterate a few times to get Google repo to ingest
     your manifest as intended If you end up importing more

* The Master/Main "Debate"

** It's Time To Put This Shit To Bed

**Too Long, Don't Care** -- =git= should probably be patched to put an end to
this /ridiculous, etymologically inaccurate fiasco/ by making main an alias to
master...

It's all for CRT mind-control word games to drive more division by triggering
thoughts in event-driven fashion at high-volumes. /All day, every day -- for
anyone who touches git./ *Somebody call Syd Barrett:* they comin' for the Pink
Floyd masters next. Your /Master's degree/? That derives from the same sense of
the etymological source as git's master, the Latin magister. No, this is
literally a CRISPR mind-control [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kilz4-SxLlw&t=115s][retrovirus]] firstmost. VP heads should be rolling
at quite a few silicon valley firms for proactively seeding division with CRT's
private little word games.

There is a difference between nouns and adjectives which denote a capacity for
agency and those which don't. In git, the adjective or adjectival noun master
does /not/ denote something with agency. In git (and afaik in source control
systems dating back to Sourcesafe) the word master is never seen opposite the
designation slave ... and in contexts where that does happen, the conventions
and norms should probably be changed. However, those are usually devices and
systems with some capacity for agency.

IMO, a resolution to the argument settled by etymology or subjective
connotations is unsatisfactory. For the designations master/slave, they do not
confer enough degrees of designation. The term root is satisfactory in its
ability to designate consensus on the original master copy of something used for
shared work -- like an original Hollywood Reel or a studio master produced by a
mastering engineer. And yes the adjectival gerund "mastering" detracts a bit
from my agent-noun argument.

But, alas, unless we plan on burning copies of the Oxford Dictionaries, we are
stuck with the English word [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/master][master]], derived [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Glossary#doublet][as a doublet]] from Italian [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/maestro#Italian][maestro]]
and ultimately Latin [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/magister#Latin][magister]], which thereby conferred its connotations of
record-keeping (viz. magistrate). And, please, don't make me bust out my copy of
Émile Benviniste's [[https://www.amazon.com/Dictionary-Indo-European-Concepts-Society-Benveniste/dp/0986132594/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=benveniste&qid=1623691293&sr=8-1][Dictionary of Indo-European Concepts of Society]] or make me
explain how the wheel's impact on the commerce of ideas implies that the
Proto-Indoeuropean language is kinda bullshit. Learn your shit before you force
all of software engineering to parameterize what could otherwise be a norm.

Main is not the proper designation for a master branch. Think of the morpheme
main as part of the term mainstream, for example. Is mainstream a master or
/root/ copy of anything? No. In the context of "mainline", the morpheme main
does confer the meaning of root. It's a mixed bag. IMO, the term root should be
used in place of both master and main. However, if you've worked in devops, then
you know that the term master or the concept of root aren't really satisfactory.

I cannot stand the marxist dialectic: I look forward to a future wherein we can
say definitively that racism is in our past. I do not want to live in a future
where we have retroactively defined projects such as =git=, =linux=, =Facebook=,
=Google=, =Ruby on Rails= et alias as part of a formerly racist culture simply
because they used the term master, outside of its agent-noun sense. Linux?
Racist?

By the way, the response to police brutality and indeed Black Lives Matter
itself was catalyzed by the democratization of /data science/. It was created in
response to government records becoming publicly available and mineable
datasets. It was always a pre-ordained development and one that was perhaps
prophesied by Sun Ra, [[https://www.weirdstudies.com/60][an African American polymath]] and unsung hero who briefly
lectured on fascinating topics at /BERKLEY/ in the early seventies. In his movie
[[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072195/][Space Is the Place]], Sun Ra used the double image of a playing card and
video-playing tablet device. Why? To show how violence could be videotaped and
shared -- /apparently without revealing his hand/. If police had been featured
in the video clip, then it would be too obvious that justice was coming ... and
then it never would.

Why do I care? Because norms are efficient and consensus on norms is expensive.
And also because it is the height of fraudulence for software engineering
institutions to pretend they did anything to advance African American issues by
social-engineering the normative designation of master in source control. And
none of this controversy translates well outside of America by the way. You are
out of touch. And problaly white to think that you are a hero for mainstreaming
the master/main controversy.

+ Still with me? Good.
+ Vehemently disagree with me? I don't care.
+ Happen to rename your branches to main from master? So had I.

You do you. I'll do me, but I'm not contributing my energy to this mess anymore.

Use it as input for a buffer or variable. If you created a variable for babel,
use it as input for another babel block or use =M-!= to feed the selected lines
from a buffer to a shell script that runs something like:

- [[https://www.instructables.com/Using-Googles-repo-command-in-your-own-projects/][how to set up in other new projects]]

***** Main Question (before doing this)

+ can many =*.xml= files share a repo when they do not produce a common manifest?
  - if so, it's possible to create a repo with a bunch of these manifests and serve them into repos...
    - which would need to be branches or workgroups.
    - so probably not, but the Chromium/Android projects are huge (each easily 15+ gb if not careful with =repo=)

****** Some concepts:
- the manifests are mostly meant to exist remotely (to config groups of builds/repos or etc). it would seem that they are also meant to mostly be managed remotely (esp. at google)
- there is an alternative tool whose design is based on repo, but which doesn't force you to store a manifest in a separate repo ... but it would seem that manifest/s/ must exist in their own repo.
  - whether you can pull off hosting a dozen of them in one repo remains
    unclear. certainly this was not the intent of Google
  - you can =<include name=fdsa.xml/>= in xml files to split out remotes, but this is intended to produce mostly one main =xml= file (which other devs may expect to layer changes onto; branches/groups/etc)
    - repo branching would make multiple =xml manifests= in a single "repo
      repo" problematic. (branching could theoretically be used to provide this feature of multiple XML's in one reporepo .... but that's insane)
  - so it looks like the guy who wrote the alternative repo tool is correct: it don't do that (which isn't that big of a deal)

****** Some caveats:
  - The =./repo= folder is meant the only of it's kind (afaik?) at the root of a repo project.
  - symlinks in paths have a quite a few rules in them.

******** I just want lists of dumb, cloned repos that can be easily pulled if needed (and if their tree isn't in a dirty state)

******* TODO create initial symlinks for: julia, clojure, CAD
******* TODO migrate /some/ existing notes to ~org~ using [[https://pandoc.org/installing.html][pandoc]]
******* TODO address problem where whitelisting files in gitignore doesn't work

****** Mu Repo

Tool and approach to clone/sync repos in a language sub/folder. For now, i've
settled on [[https://fabioz.github.io/mu-repo/][mu-repo]] and i'll potentially revert to mixu/gr or autogit. I would
like this to be scriptable and regeneratable (with minimal effort)

To install =mu-repo=:

#+begin_src shell :tangle no
sudo pacman -Syu python-pip
pip install mu-repo
#+end_src

Basic =mu-repo= usage:

#+begin_src shell :tangle no
mu register --recursive # recursively register all repos
mu register --current # register with depth 1

#+end_src

To create for new metaprojects, do the following, more or less. For mu-repo to
reclone all the projects, you must configure some path-dependent rules so that
the correct =mu-repo.remote-base-url= config key is available. To retrieve this
config key from within the containing metaproject root directory, you must init
a blank repository anyways (otherwise, git will not retrieve commit keys). You
could take [[https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-handle-multiple-git-configurations-in-one-machine/][this approach]] and have git deep-merge a partial
~.gitconfig-metaproject~ config into your ~$HOME/.gitconfig~, which requires
relevent configuration being placed in two places (i.e. lines changed in
~$HOME/.gitconfig~ and the merged gitconfig in the metaproject). But, you must
create a blank repo anyways for =mu-repo= to access its config keys... so it's
best to alter the ~$METAPROJECT/.git/config~ ... which needs not be in git.
Other features of mu-repo also benefit from an arbitrary blank-repo at the
metaproject root. ~<le-sigh>~
